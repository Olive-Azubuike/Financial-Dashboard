This project involves creating a financial dashboard using Python, with data sourced from Yahoo Finance.
The dashboard is presented on Streamlit and features interactive elements. It provides stock information for all S&P 500 companies.

The first tab is a summary, which includes the company profile, description, major shareholders, and a stock price chart. Additionally, 
there is a sidebar with a drop-down menu that allows you to select a company of your choice, along with an update button to refresh the information across all tabs.

The second tab displays a stock price chart that can be toggled between a line plot and a candlestick chart. Users can also select a specific date range for analysis.

The third tab features a Monte Carlo simulation along with a histogram chart for value-at-risk analysis.

The fourth tab provides detailed financial information about the selected stock.

Finally, the last tab includes a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) analysis.
